<h1> Hi there! ðŸ‘‹, my name is Hilfran Marquez. </h1>

I am a computer engineer and have worked as a Project Manager, Systems Administrator, and Technical Support. I am a professional with a lot of curiosity, and I enjoy constantly learning about new technologies. Currently, I am delving into the fascinating world of Blockchain. I believe that this technology has the potential to radically change the way things work, and I want to be a part of it.
